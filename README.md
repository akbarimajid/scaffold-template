# Scaffold Template

**Build your MVP with AI that never forgets**

This template implements the **Shadow AI system** - institutional memory for AI-assisted development.

## Problem Solved
AI coding tools lose context after 1 session. This system preserves 100% context across unlimited sessions.

## What's Included
- **Shadow AI System:** `.ai/shadow_memory.md` (87% token reduction)
- **Task Management:** `tasks/` directory with proven workflow
- **AI Policies:** `docs/policies/` for consistent agent behavior
- **Automation:** `Makefile` for common commands

## Quick Start

1. **Clone this repo**
2. **Read Context:** Read `.ai/shadow_memory.md` to understand the system
3. **Create Task:** Copy `tasks/TEMPLATE.md` to `tasks/01-pending-my-feature.md`
4. **Start Building:** Use your AI agent (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) to execute the task

## Battle-Tested
Built a production algo-trading system in 58 tasks with zero knowledge loss using this exact framework.
